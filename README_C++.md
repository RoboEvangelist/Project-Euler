Project-Euler
=============

Solutions to Project Euler's mathematical problems that I work on during my free time

To run the C++ solutions, just run:
>
>     path_to_repository_folder/make
>

then run an executable in this way:
>
>     path_to_repository/./Problem#
>
where (#) is the problem number
